# Meet the coder you dont want to hire.. yet!

My intent for my portfolio was to provide my future employer a website that showcases my technical skills with the programming languages HTML and CSS. 

This portfolio was buit with HTML and CSS. It allows the user to obtain the following information: my name, about me, my previous work, ways to contact me, and a link to my resume. 

The user will either scroll through the page to view my work or the links in the navegation bar will take them to that specific part of the page.
